## Technical Details

The extension generates temporary `.pptx` files containing the selected shape, which are automatically opened in PowerPoint. The temporary files are automatically cleaned up after 60 seconds (configurable in preferences).

Shapes are stored as JSON definitions compatible with PptxGenJS, ensuring they maintain full vector editability in PowerPoint.

## Configuration

Access preferences through Raycast Settings → Extensions → PowerPoint Shapes Library:

- **PowerPoint Template Path**: **[RECOMMENDED]** Path to a PPTX template with your company theme. This ensures all captured shapes preserve your company's colors, fonts, and branding. Leave empty to use Office default theme.
  - Example: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\CompanyTemplate.pptx`
  - Create a template by saving any PowerPoint with your company theme
- **Enable Cache**: Cache shape definitions for faster loading (default: enabled)
- **Auto Cleanup Temp Files**: Delete temporary PowerPoint files after 60 seconds (default: enabled)
- **Library Folder**: Custom location for storing shapes (leave empty for default app data directory)
- **Auto-save after capture**: Skip the form and save immediately after capture (default: disabled)
- **Force Exact Shapes Only**: Require native PPTX files for 100% fidelity (default: enabled)
- **Use PPTX Library Deck**: Store all shapes in a single PPTX deck for faster access (default: enabled)
- **Skip native PPTX save at capture**: Faster capture by skipping native file save (default: enabled)

### Using a Custom PowerPoint Template (Recommended for Corporate Use)

To ensure all captured shapes maintain your company's branding (colors, fonts, theme):

1. **Create a Template**:
   - Open PowerPoint with your company theme/template
   - Save it to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\CompanyTemplate.pptx`)

2. **Configure the Extension**:
   - Open Raycast → Extensions → PowerPoint Shapes Library → Preferences
   - Set **PowerPoint Template Path** to your template file path
   - Example: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\CompanyTemplate.pptx`

3. **Benefits**:
   - ✅ **100% Color Fidelity**: Theme colors (Accent 1, Accent 2, etc.) are preserved exactly
   - ✅ **Font Preservation**: Headers, body text, and all fonts maintain formatting
   - ✅ **Brand Consistency**: All shapes use your company's visual identity
   - ✅ **Automatic Application**: Template is used for all captures and library operations

**Without a template**, shapes will use Office's default theme, which may change colors and fonts.

### Managing Categories

Categories can be fully customized using the **Manage Categories** command:

1. Open Raycast and search for "Manage Categories"
2. Or press `Cmd+M` from the Shape Picker

**Available actions:**
- **Add New Category**: Create categories with custom names and IDs
- **Rename Category**: Change the display name of any category
- **Delete Category**: Remove empty categories (categories with shapes cannot be deleted)

Categories are stored in `{LibraryRoot}/categories.json` and persist across sessions.

### Generating Previews (Windows Only)

Generate high-quality PNG previews for all shapes:

```bash
npm run generate-previews
```

Or use the PowerShell script directly:

```powershell
.\scripts\batch-generate-previews.ps1
```

### Technical Details

**Shape Storage**: Shapes are stored as JSON files in category-specific directories (`shapes/basic/`, `shapes/arrows/`, etc.). Each shape JSON contains metadata, PptxGenJS definition, and references to preview files.

**Preview System**: Dual-mode preview system:
1. **PNG Previews** (High Quality): Generated using PowerPoint COM API on Windows
2. **SVG Previews** (Instant Fallback): Generated on-the-fly for basic shapes

**Platform Support**:
- **Windows**: Full support including direct insertion via COM API
- **macOS**: Search, browse, and open shapes (manual paste required)
