All notable changes to the PowerPoint Shapes Library extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- 🚀 **Customizable Categories UI**: New "Manage Categories" command to add, rename, and delete categories directly from the extension
- 🎯 **Dynamic Category System**: Categories are now stored in `{LibraryRoot}/categories.json` and can be customized without editing code
- ⌨️ **Quick Access**: Press `Cmd+M` in Shape Picker to open category management
- 🔗 **Smart Navigation**: Open Shape Picker filtered by selected category from Manage Categories (`Cmd+O`)

### Changed
- 📁 **Categories Location**: Moved from static `src/config/categories.json` to user-configurable `{LibraryRoot}/categories.json`
- 🎨 **UI Cleanup**: Removed technical IDs from category list, showing only display names
- ⚙️ **Settings Simplification**: Removed static "Default Category" dropdown from preferences (always opens on "All Shapes")

### Removed

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-31

### Removed
- **"Save Native Now" action**: Removed as problematic and redundant
  - Action generated native PPTX using `pptxgenjs` (synthetic generation)
  - Would apply Office default theme instead of configured custom template
  - Defeated the purpose of template-based color/font fidelity (v1.2.0)
  - All shapes now automatically get native PPTX during capture with correct template
  - No longer needed - recapturing shapes is the correct way to regenerate native files

### Changed
- Updated error messages to guide users to recapture shapes instead of using removed action
- Cleaner action panel with only essential utilities

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-31

### Removed
- **"Recreate Library Deck with Current Theme" action**: Removed as unnecessary with template-based approach

- **"Repair Broken Previews" action**: Removed as preview management is now more robust
  - Preview files are automatically moved when changing categories (added in v1.1.0)
  - Template-based approach prevents theme-related preview issues
  - Action and `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R` keyboard shortcut removed

### Changed
- Simplified action panel in Shape Browser for cleaner UX
- Reduced maintenance surface by removing redundant utilities

  - Fully backward compatible - leave empty to use Office default theme
- Color normalization functions for backward compatibility with older shape definitions
  - Automatically adds `#` prefix to hex colors for proper RGB interpretation

  - Ensures consistent theming across entire library
  - Template theme is preserved when adding new shapes to deck

### Fixed
- **Theme Color Preservation**: Fixed issue where Theme Colors (Accent 1, Accent 2, etc.) were converted to Office default colors
  - Previously, shapes lost company branding colors during capture
  - Now maintains exact color fidelity when using custom template
- **Font Formatting Preservation**: Fixed issue where font styles (headers, body text) were changed during capture
  - Custom fonts and text formatting now preserved 100%
